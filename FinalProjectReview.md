<h1>DRoP Web Application Final Review</h1>

Drop is a pretty simple project. Its main objective is to manage blood donors through a collection of dates, times, and names so that donation facilities can manage their expectations and plan accordingly. Looking back at what I’ve learned until now, I could probably redo this project and finish it in less than a week.

Throughout the development of DRoP, I debated over making it more complicated than it should be - the database which started with 5 tables, now only contains 2 and the amount of information that was planned to be collected, ended up being scrapped and now only takes the most minimal amount of information. 

I hate to admit that I procrastinated too much and underestimated the project, especially because I thought it would be easy. Many times I got too deep into designing the pages using tools such as bootstrap studio and Adobe XD to make them look more appealing and include more functions which most of the time got scrapped and wasn’t added to the final product. These distractions, even with the help of the kanban board, were what kept me from the necessary tasks that would have aided finishing the project a lot sooner. 

In the end, the most important part is having a functioning application that accomplishes its most basic requirements. Everything else can be done with however much time is left in the end. In this case, an application that can take a user’s name, phone number, the date and time of their planned donation, and logging all that information in an always-available database is what was most important and could have been accomplished a lot sooner.

## 3 Basic Requirements 
<ol>
  <li>Donors can schedule appointment</li>
  <li>Donors can screen for eligibility</li>
  <li>Admin can view and manage appointments</li>
</ol>
